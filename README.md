<h1> <a href="https://msweeper.com"> Minesweeper App </a> </h1>
Hello y'all Minesweepers! We really love Minesweeper so we made this website for you to play Minesweeper! <br/>
It has a more modern UI than the other Minesweeper websites (I will let you judge) while still preserving the old school design, we also incorporated features such as sliderbar for the difficulty (try swiping it!!), Leaderboard (be on the top ðŸ˜Ž), and lastly profile stats (winrate, total game, etc) and in-game store (coming soon! buy stuff with in game coins ðŸ’°ðŸ’°)

  <li> Middle click for fast reveal </li>
</ol>

<h1> Why we build this website </h1> 
<h2> tl;dr: Just two college students who can't get a job after 100+ of applications and decided to do something (at least) useful </h2>
<h2> Jing Xian and I decided to make this website as not just something to put on our resume, but also as a learning opportunity for things like Firebase and also solidify our understandings to React, Express and stuff. We also both really like minesweeper but aren't really satisfied with the current design of most popular minesweeper websites (for example most of them don't really have great UX for mobile), so we decided to make our own! It's been a great experience and both of us learned a lot of useful skills (e.g. CI/CD!) that appears very frequently on job posting descriptions :D </h2>
<h1> Technical Details </h1>
<li> Tech stacks: JavaScript/TypeScript, Firebase, React, TailwindCSS and Express. </li> 
<li> For testing: Cypress, Jest </li> 
<li> REST API, also act as a cache to reduce Firebase usage </li>
<li> Secured, http-only cookie encoded/decoded with JWT for state persistence </li>
<li> ... </li>
